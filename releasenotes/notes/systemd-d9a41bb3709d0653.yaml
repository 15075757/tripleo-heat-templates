    Latest commits in puppet-systemd enabled by default systemd-networkd and
    systemd-resolved but we don't want to manage them for now in TripleO.
    MySQL and MongoDB services were managing some systemd resources so now
    we ensure that these 2 systemd services are disabled. In the future, we
    might want and activate these services and revert that patch but for now
    we want to disable them.
