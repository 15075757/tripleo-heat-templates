    CloudName is now a required parameter. Given that FQDNs are now the
    default instead of IP addresses, to avoid people using the localdomain
    (which used to be the default for domain for CloudName), we now remove
    the default, and require folks to set their own.

    The overcloud endpoints now point to FQDNs instead of IP addresses.
    This was done as part of the public TLS by default work, and is needed
    since the certificates have FQDNs for SubjectAltNames.
