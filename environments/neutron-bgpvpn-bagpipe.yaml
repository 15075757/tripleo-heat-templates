# A Heat environment file that can be used to deploy Neutron Bagpipe driver as
# backend for BGPVPN service plugin
#
# The BaGPipe driver for the BGPVPN service plugin is designed to work jointly
# with the openvswitch ML2 mechanism driver. It relies on the use of the 
# bagpipe-bgp BGP VPN implementation on compute node and the MPLS implementation
# in OpenVSwitch.
