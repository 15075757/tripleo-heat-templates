# We run the upgrade steps without disabling the OS::TripleO::PostDeploySteps
# this means you can do a major upgrade in one pass, which may be useful
# e.g for all-in-one deployments where we can upgrade the compute services
# at the same time as the controlplane
# Note that it will be necessary to pass a mapping of OS::Heat::None again for
# any subsequent updates, or the upgrade steps will run again.
