    When the undercloud was not containerized, the neutron database name was called neutron.
    When we upgrade to a containerized undercloud, the database name is called ovs_neutron.
    We introduced MigrateLegacyNeutronDb (false by default in the service but true when
    the undercloud is containerized) that will rename the database during host_prep_tasks.
