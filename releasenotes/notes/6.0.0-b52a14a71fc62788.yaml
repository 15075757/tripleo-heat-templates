prelude: >
    6.0.0 is the final release for Ocata.
    It's the first release where release notes are added.
features:
  - Fujitsu Neutron plugin for FOS support.  Users can deploy
    Neutron with this plugin by using
    environments/neutron-ml2-fujitsu-fossw.yaml environment file.
  - Expose InstanceDiscoveryMethod parameter to configure Ceilometer
    method used to discover instances running on compute node.
    Default value to 'libvirt_metadata'. Allowed values are 'naive',
    'libvirt_metadata' and 'workload_partitioning'.
  - Make ServiceNetMap support custom network names.
    Note that operators will still be expected to pass any ServiceNetMap
    overrides with the "new" network name, e.g whatever NetName specifies,
    otherwise environment files could get very confusing.
  - Nova Placement API support.  As this new service is required, deploy it
    by default in WSGI with Apache, like other API services.
  - Cinder pass-through iSER backend support.
  - etcd composable services, used by networking-vpp ML2 driver as the
    messaging mechanism.
  - Allow to configure cron parameters for Cinder, Heat, Keystone and Nova
    crontabs.
  - Export NovaDefaultFloatingPool parameter to configure the default pool
    of floating IP addressed available. Default to 'public' for backward
    compatibility.
  - Bump Heat Templates to 'ocata' version, to match Heat requirements.
  - Configure OVS agent firewall driver only if NeutronOVSFirewallDriver
    is set.
  - Expose RbdDefaultFeatures parameter to configure the default features
    enabled when creating a block device image.
    Only applies to format '2' images. Set to '1' for Jewel clients using
    older Ceph servers.
  - Cinder HPELeftHandISCSIDriver backend support.
  - Pacemaker stopped to manage Ceilometer, Cinder API,
    Cinder Scheduler, MongoDB, Glance, Gnocchi, Heat, Apache, Memcached,
    Neutron, Nova and Sahara.
  - Ceph MDS service support. Service can be enable with
    environments/services/ceph-mds.yaml environment file.
  - Expose HeatConvergenceEngine and HeatMaxResourcesPerStack parameters
    to configure Heat.
  - Add pre-network hook and example showing config-then-reboot.
  - Expose LibvirtEnabledPerfEvents parameter in Nova Compute service.
    Default to an empty array.
    This is a performance event list which could be used as monitor.
  - Increase libvirt/qemu.conf max_files to 32768 and max_processes to
    131072.
  - Split OVN northd and ml2 plugin, so we can deploy OVNDBs and Northd
    services on different nodes.
  - Add hook to generate metadata from service profiles.
    This is useful for nova vendordata plugins that can parse said metadata.
  - Expose EventPipelinePublishers to Ceilometer and set the default to
    'notifier://?topic=alarm.all'.
  - Add Panko service support. This service is not enabled by default. Use
    environments/services/enable-panko.yaml to include it in your deployment.
  - Add EC2-API composable service support.
upgrade:
  - Update OpenDaylight deployment to use networking-odl v2 as a mechanism
    driver.
deprecations:
  - Glance Registry service has been removed and Glance API v2 is now deploy
    by default. Glance API v1 is not supported anymore in TripleO.
  - Remove CeilometerStoreEvents parameter, which has been removed
    in Ceilometer.
  - Ceilometer API service is deprecated and will be removed in a future
    release. If you would like to disable it, use
    environments/services/disable-ceilometer-api.yaml environment file.
  - Removes deprecated OpenDaylight L2 only deployments.
    Deploying ODL without L3 DVR is no longer supported.
security:
  - Disallow iframe embed in Horizon configuration to prevent dashboard being
    embedded within an iframe and exposed to Cross-Frame Scripting (XFS)
    vulnerability on legacy browsers.
  - Allow management of enforce_password_check in Horizons configuration to
    display an 'Admin Password' field on the Change Password form to verify that
    it is indeed the admin logged-in who wants to change the password.
  - Allow management of disable_password_reveal in Horizon, to remove the
    password reveal option.
  - Enable secure_proxy_ssl_header option in Horizons configuration to take
    X-Forwarded-Proto header into account when forming URLs.
fixes:
  - Fixes `bug 1645898
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/tripleo/+bug/1645898>`__ so epmd is binded on
    the right address, where RabbitMQ is listening too.
  - Fixes `bug 1652184
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/tripleo/+bug/1652184>`__ so swap partitions
    can be handled from an environment file thanks to AllNodesExtraConfig.
  - Add retry to RHEL registration, useful when having network outages during
    registration.
  - Fixes `bug 1651476
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/tripleo/+bug/1651476>`__ so firewall rules
    are created for Opendaylight API service.
  - Fixes `bug 1643487
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/tripleo/+bug/1643487>`__ to prevent source
    address from binding to a VIP for database connection.
